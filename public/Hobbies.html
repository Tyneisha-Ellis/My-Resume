        <p> I will always be on the hunt for a new restaurant in my area. I'm a big fan of exploring towns for hole in the wall delights. But that is not the only thing that keeps me busy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Entertaining my pup; Valentino is at the top of the list.</li>
                <li>Dragging my friends and Family out to a movies.</li>
                <li>Working on my personal blog; something I hope to have up by the end of the year.</li>
            </ul>
